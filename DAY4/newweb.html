                <p>Doodling refers to drawing, sketching, or scribbling idly, while a person's attention is otherwise
                    occupied. They are basic sketches that may have concrete relevance for representation or can be

                    Typically, these hand-drawn forms are a product of anger, exhaustion, and stress. Some individuals
                    become restless during a meeting, and they dislike doing nothing, and they start doodling to ease
                    their boredom.

                    doodling while listening to someone feeding you data can help you better recall the details. The
